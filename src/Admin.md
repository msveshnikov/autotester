# File: src\Admin.jsx

## Overview

`Admin.jsx` is a React functional component that renders the administrative dashboard for the
application. It provides an interface for viewing key statistics, managing users, presentations, and
feedback entries. The dashboard fetches data from various backend API endpoints and allows
administrators to perform actions like deleting items and updating user subscriptions or
presentation privacy settings.

## Role in Project

Located in the `src` directory, `Admin.jsx` serves as a primary top-level page component, likely
accessible only to users with administrator privileges. It interacts heavily with the backend API
(specifically the routes defined in `server/admin.js` and potentially others) to retrieve data and
perform administrative actions. It relies on `App.jsx` for defining the `API_URL` and is expected to
be integrated into the application's routing system (potentially managed within `App.jsx`). It
utilizes the Chakra UI library for its user interface and Chart.js for data visualization.

## Dependencies

- **React:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef` (for state management, side effects,
  memoization, and element references).
- **Chakra UI:** A comprehensive set of UI components used for layout, styling, tables, buttons,
  modals, stats, tabs, etc. (e.g., `Container`, `Table`, `Tabs`, `AlertDialog`, `Stat`,
  `SimpleGrid`, `Button`, `useToast`, `Spinner`).
- **Chakra Icons:** `DeleteIcon` for delete buttons.
- **react-chartjs-2 & chart.js:** For rendering Line and Pie charts to visualize data on the
  overview tab. Imports specific chart elements and registers them with Chart.js.
- **Internal:** `API_URL` from `./App` (defines the base URL for API calls).
