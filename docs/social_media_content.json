        "**[Showcasing] AutoTester.dev: First AI-driven automatic test tool for webapps**\n\nHey r/webdev and r/testing! Wanted to share a project I've been working on: AutoTester.dev. The goal is to use AI (specifically Gemini) to automate the entire web testing process.\n\nKey ideas:\n- Generate test cases *automatically* from documentation links (like JIRA/Confluence tickets).\n- Use AI for intelligent element interaction (less flaky tests!)\n- Automated execution and reporting.\n\nThe vision is to free up developers and QA engineers from tedious test creation/maintenance so they can focus on building. The core AI generation workflow is a key focus right now.\n\nCheck it out or learn more about the concept: https://autotester.dev\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on AI in test automation and what your biggest pain points are!",
        "**Tired of writing boilerplate web tests? Building AutoTester.dev - AI that generates tests from your docs (JIRA/Confluence)**\n\nConstantly writing and maintaining test scripts is a huge time sink. My project, AutoTester.dev, is aiming to solve this by using AI to automatically generate test scenarios directly from your existing project documentation (think user stories in JIRA or specs in Confluence).\n\nThe idea is you provide the doc link and the web app URL, and the AI generates the test cases and steps. It also uses AI to interact with elements more robustly.\n\nStill actively developing the core AI generation logic, but the framework is there.\n\nCurious about your thoughts on this approach and if you see potential here. \n\nMore info: https://autotester.dev\n\n#testing #automation #AI #webdevelopment #qualityassurance",
        "**Discussion: How can AI make web testing less painful? Sharing AutoTester.dev's approach (AI element interaction & reporting)**\n\nOne of the biggest pains in web test automation is dealing with flaky tests due to minor UI changes. We're tackling this in AutoTester.dev by using AI for more intelligent and adaptive element interaction.\n\nBeyond generation, the platform also handles automated execution across environments and provides comprehensive reports.\n\nThe goal is to make testing faster, more reliable, and less of a maintenance burden.\n\nWhat are your biggest challenges with web test automation today? Do you think AI is the answer?\n\nCheck out AutoTester.dev: https://autotester.dev\n\n#softwaretesting #qa #automation #AI #webapps #frontend"
