Okay, Product Owner Agent. Based on the provided context, backlog, and the goal of getting the core
AI testing loop functional, here is a sprint plan for AutoTester.dev.

---

# Sprint Plan: AutoTester.dev - Sprint 1 (Core MVP Loop)

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the initial end-to-end workflow allowing a user to input documentation
and web app URLs, trigger AI-driven test generation, execute those tests, and view a basic report.

**Duration:** 2 Weeks (Assuming a standard sprint length) **Start Date:** Mon Jul 14 2025 (Assuming
the sprint starts the next business day after the backlog definition)

## 1. Selected User Stories and Tasks

Based on the P0 priorities aimed at achieving the sprint goal, the following items are selected:

1.  **US: As a user, I can provide links to documentation and the web app URL to start the test
    generation process.**

    - _Description:_ Implement the necessary input fields (for documentation link and target app
      URL) and a "Generate & Run Tests" button on the main user interface (`Landing.jsx` or
      `App.jsx`). This UI should capture the inputs and call a new backend endpoint.
    - _Source:_ P0 Backlog Item 1, README TODO 1
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 3 Story Points

2.  **Feature: Initial Server Endpoint for Test Workflow.**

    - _Description:_ Create a new server endpoint (e.g., `/api/run-test-workflow`) that accepts the
      documentation link and target app URL from the frontend. This endpoint will coordinate the
      subsequent steps (AI generation, execution, reporting).
    - _Source:_ Derived from P0 Backlog Items 1, 2, 3, 4 (the glue)
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 2 Story Points

3.  **Feature: Initial AI Test Case Generation Logic.**

    - _Description:_ Implement the server-side logic within the new workflow endpoint to call the
      Gemini integration (`server/gemini.js`). This logic should attempt to parse the provided
      documentation link and potentially the target app URL structure to generate a _minimal set_ of
      test steps (e.g., navigate, click a specific element, type into an input) in a structured
      format that the execution engine can consume. Focus on a simple, defined scenario for this
      sprint.
    - _Source:_ P0 Backlog Item 2, README TODO 2
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 8 Story Points (High complexity/unknowns)

4.  **Feature: Initial Automated Test Execution Engine Logic.**

    - _Description:_ Implement the server-side logic within the new workflow endpoint to take the
      test steps generated by the AI (or a hardcoded set for testing) and execute them against the
      target web application URL using a headless browser (e.g., integrate Puppeteer or Playwright).
      Focus on implementing basic actions like `navigate`, `click`, `type`.
    - _Source:_ P0 Backlog Item 3, README TODO 3
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 8 Story Points (High complexity/setup)

5.  **Feature: Basic Test Execution Reporting Capture & Storage.**

    - _Description:_ Integrate logic into the execution engine to capture the overall success or
      failure status of the test run. Store this basic result along with the input URLs and a
      timestamp in the database (`server/models/TestReport.js`).
    - _Source:_ P0 Backlog Item 4
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 3 Story Points

6.  **Feature: Basic Test Execution Reporting Display.**

    - _Description:_ Create a simple UI element (e.g., on the `Landing.jsx` page or a new basic
      "Results" view) that displays the status (Success/Failure) of the most recent test workflow
      run initiated by the user. Fetch the basic report data stored in P0.4.
    - _Source:_ P0 Backlog Item 4
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 3 Story Points

7.  **Feature: Refine User Authentication for New Endpoints.**
    - _Description:_ Ensure the existing authentication middleware (`server/middleware/auth.js`)
      correctly protects the new `/api/run-test-workflow` endpoint. Verify that only authenticated
      users can trigger the test workflow. Address any critical bugs found in the existing
      login/signup flows during this process.
    - _Source:_ P0 Backlog Item 5
    - _Estimated Effort:_ 5 Story Points

## 2. Estimated Effort

- US: Provide input links (P0.1): 3 Story Points
- Feature: Initial Server Endpoint (Derived): 2 Story Points
- Feature: Initial AI Gen Logic (P0.2): 8 Story Points
- Feature: Initial Execution Logic (P0.3): 8 Story Points
- Feature: Basic Reporting Capture (P0.4): 3 Story Points
- Feature: Basic Reporting Display (P0.4): 3 Story Points
- Feature: Auth Refinement (P0.5): 5 Story Points

**Total Estimated Sprint Effort:** 32 Story Points

_Note: This is a high point total for a single sprint, reflecting the significant complexity and
foundational nature of the selected items. It assumes a dedicated team focused solely on these
tasks. The high estimates for AI Generation and Execution reflect the inherent unknowns and setup
required._

## 3. Dependencies and Risks

**Dependencies:**

- Items 3, 4, 5 depend on Item 2 (the new server endpoint).
- Item 2 depends on Item 1 (the frontend UI to call it).
- Item 6 depends on Item 5 (reporting data being stored).
- Item 7 (Auth) needs to be addressed concurrently with or before Items 2, 3, 4, 5 to ensure secure
  development.
- Items 3 (AI Gen) depends on the Gemini API integration (`server/gemini.js`) being functional.
- Item 4 (Execution) depends on a headless browser environment being set up and available on the
  server.
- Items 5 & 6 depend on the `TestReport.js` model being defined and the database accessible.

**Risks:**

- **Complexity & Unknowns (High):** The AI generation (Item 3) and test execution (Item 4) logic are
  highly complex. Integrating the Gemini API and setting up/stabilizing headless browser automation
  carry significant technical risk. Estimates for these items could be inaccurate.
- **External API/Service Issues (High):** Reliance on the Gemini API (availability, rate limits,
  quality of output for test case generation) and the stability of the headless browser environment
  are potential blockers.
- **Parsing Difficulty (Medium):** Successfully extracting meaningful information from arbitrary
  documentation links and dynamically analyzing web app structures for element interaction points
  could be harder than expected.
- **Integration Challenges (Medium):** Getting the frontend, the new server endpoint, the AI logic,
  the execution engine, database storage, and basic reporting display to work together seamlessly
  will require careful coordination.
- **Authentication Scope (Medium):** The scope of "Refine User Authentication" (Item 7) needs to be
  strictly limited to securing the new endpoint and fixing critical path bugs to avoid scope creep.
- **Infrastructure/Environment Setup (Medium):** Setting up the server environment with necessary
  dependencies (Node.js, potentially specific browser binaries for the headless browser, database
  connection) needs to be smooth.

## 4. Definition of Done (DoD)

For each selected item to be considered "Done" within this sprint:

- Code is written, reviewed, and merged to the main development branch.
- Automated tests (unit, integration) are written for key server-side logic (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7).
- Functionality is deployed to a staging or development environment.
- Manual testing confirms the item meets its description and acceptance criteria for this sprint's
  scope (e.g., UI fields appear and call the backend, the backend endpoint receives data, AI logic
  _attempts_ generation and returns _some_ output format, execution logic _attempts_ to run steps
  and captures _a_ status, basic status is displayed, the endpoint requires authentication).
- Basic error handling is implemented within the new workflow logic to prevent crashes for expected
  issues (e.g., invalid URLs).
- Relevant internal documentation (e.g., README updates, API endpoint descriptions) is updated.
- No new critical or blocking bugs are introduced.

**Overall Sprint Goal Definition of Done:**

- The end-to-end workflow can be successfully triggered from the UI with valid inputs.
- The server successfully processes the request, calls the initial AI generation logic, receives
  output, and passes it to the initial execution engine.
- The execution engine attempts to run the steps in a headless browser against the target URL.
- A basic success or failure status is captured and stored in the database.
- The basic status of the latest run is displayed to the user in the UI.
- The workflow endpoint is secured by user authentication.
- The core path of the workflow is demonstrable and testable in the staging environment.
