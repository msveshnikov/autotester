Okay, Product Owner Agent. Based on the `README.md`, the provided project structure (which indicates
some work or planning beyond the README's main sections), and the explicit `TODO` list, here is an
updated product backlog for AutoTester.dev as of Sat Jul 12 2025.

**Notes:**

- The `TODO` list from the README is treated as the immediate, highest-priority tasks needed to get
  the core AI testing loop functional.
- Items implied by the project structure (like `TestPlan.js`, `TestReport.js`, `Feedback.jsx`) are
  added, reflecting recent developments or planned work.
- Design Ideas are incorporated as features or enhancements, prioritized based on building the core
  value first.
- The current backlog was empty, so this is the initial populated backlog.

# AutoTester.dev Product Backlog

## P0: Core AI Testing Workflow - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- **US: As a user, I can provide links to documentation and the web app URL to start the test
  generation process.**

    - _Description:_ Implement the UI elements on the landing page (`Landing.jsx` or `App.jsx`) to
      accept a URL for test/ticket documentation (e.g., Jira, Confluence) and the target web
      application URL.
    - _Source:_ README TODO 1, Design Ideas (Input Handling)
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: AI Test Case Generation from Documentation & Web App Structure.**

    - _Description:_ Develop server-side logic (`server/index.js`, `server/gemini.js`) to parse the
      provided documentation and analyze the target web app's structure (inputs, buttons, etc.). Use
      the Gemini model to intelligently generate a list of test scenarios and steps based on this
      analysis. Store generated test cases (using `server/models/TestCase.js`).
    - _Source:_ README TODO 2, Design Ideas (Intelligent Test Case Generation)
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: Automated Test Execution Engine.**

    - _Description:_ Develop server-side components (`server/index.js`, potentially new files) to
      take generated test cases and execute them against the target web application URL. This
      involves simulating user interactions (clicks, input typing, navigation) based on the test
      steps.
    - _Source:_ README TODO 3, Design Ideas (Automated Test Execution)
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: Basic Test Execution Reporting.**

    - _Description:_ Capture the results of test executions (pass/fail, errors). Store basic report
      data (`server/models/TestReport.js`). Provide a simple view for the user to see if a test run
      succeeded or failed.
    - _Source:_ Key Features (Comprehensive Reporting), Implied by `TestReport.js`
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: User Authentication (Login, SignUp).**
    - _Description:_ Ensure users can securely sign up and log in to the platform. (Basic
      implementation exists, needs to be functional).
    - _Source:_ Key Features (User & Admin Management), Files exist (`Login.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`,
      `server/user.js`, `server/middleware/auth.js`)
    - _Status:_ In Progress / Needs Refinement

## P1: Improving Core Functionality & Essential Platform Features

      interact with web elements, making tests more resilient to minor UI changes.
    - _Source:_ Key Features (Intelligent Element Interaction), Design Ideas (Adaptive Element
      Locators)
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: Smart Assertion Generation & Execution.**

    - _Description:_ Integrate logic (potentially AI-assisted) to define and execute assertions
      within test steps (e.g., verify text content, element visibility, URL changes) based on
      analysis of documentation or web app state.
    - _Source:_ Design Ideas (Smart Assertion Generation)
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: Robust Error Handling & Logging.**

    - _Description:_ Implement comprehensive error handling and centralized logging
      (`server/utils.js`) across the application stack (UI, server, AI interactions, test execution)
      to aid debugging and monitoring.

    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: Basic Admin Dashboard.**

    - _Description:_ Implement core functionality in the admin panel (`Admin.jsx`,
      `server/admin.js`) to view users and monitor basic system health/activity.
    - _Source:_ Key Features (User & Admin Management), Design Ideas (Advanced Admin & Monitoring)
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: User Profile Management.**
    - _Description:_ Allow users to view and potentially update their profile information.
      (`Profile.jsx` exists).

## P2: Enhancements, Management & Quality

- **Feature: Comprehensive Test Reporting.**

    - _Description:_ Expand test reporting (`server/models/TestReport.js`) to include detailed
      step-by-step results, screenshots on failure, execution duration, and filtering/sorting
      capabilities in the UI.
    - _Source:_ Key Features (Comprehensive Reporting), Implied by `TestReport.js`
    - _Status:_ To Do

- **Feature: Test Plan Management.**

    - _Description:_ Allow users to group multiple generated test cases into logical test plans
      (`server/models/TestPlan.js`) and execute plans together.
