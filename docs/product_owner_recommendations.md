Okay team, let's look at the plan for AutoTester.dev based on our current status and goals. Today is
**Sat Jul 12 2025**.

Our primary focus for the immediate future is to build the foundational AI-driven test generation
and execution workflow. This is the core value proposition of AutoTester.dev.

Here is the proposed plan for the next sprint:

### 1. Prioritized List of Features for the Next Sprint (Maximum 5)

1.  **Implement Core Input UI on Landing Page**
2.  **Develop Server Endpoint for Test Creation Request**
3.  **Implement AI Test Case Generation Logic**
4.  **Build Basic Test Execution Engine**
5.  **Display Basic Test Execution Results**

### 2. Brief Explanation for Each Prioritized Feature

1.  **Implement Core Input UI on Landing Page:**
    - **Why:** This is the user's entry point to initiate the core function. We need a user-friendly
      way for them to provide the necessary information.
    - **What:** Add two prominent input fields/sections to `src/Landing.jsx`: one for the link/text
      of the documentation (JIRA, Confluence, etc.) and another for the URL of the web application
      to be tested. Include a button to trigger the process.
2.  **Develop Server Endpoint for Test Creation Request:**
    - **Why:** This endpoint acts as the bridge between the frontend request and the backend AI
      processing and execution logic.
    - **What:** Create a new API endpoint in `server/index.js` that receives the documentation input
      and the target web app URL from the frontend. This endpoint will orchestrate the subsequent
      steps (AI generation, execution).
3.  **Implement AI Test Case Generation Logic:**
    - **Why:** This is where the core AI intelligence comes in, translating requirements/description
      into actionable test steps.
    - **What:** Develop the server-side logic (likely involving `server/gemini.js` and
      `server/index.js`, potentially new files) to parse the provided documentation/text and the web
      app's structure (via the URL), and use the Gemini model to generate a structured list of test
      steps (a `TestCase` object, potentially saving to `server/models/TestCase.js`). This initial
      version can focus on generating steps for simple interactions (e.g., navigate, click, type).
4.  **Build Basic Test Execution Engine:**
    - **Why:** Generating tests is only half the battle; we need to run them automatically against
      the target application.
    - **What:** Develop a server-side component (potentially a new module) that can launch a
      headless browser (like Puppeteer or Playwright) and execute the steps defined in the generated
      `TestCase` against the target web app URL. This involves simulating user actions like
      navigation, clicks, and typing based on element locators provided by the AI generation step.
5.  **Display Basic Test Execution Results:**
    - **Why:** Users need to know if the test passed or failed and have some visibility into what
      happened during execution.
    - **What:** After the execution engine completes, capture a basic result (e.g., success/failure
      status). Update the UI (`src/Landing.jsx` or a new component) to display this basic outcome to
      the user. This could be as simple as "Test Passed" or "Test Failed" initially.

### 3. Suggestions for Potential New Features or Improvements

Based on the README and future vision, here are some ideas for subsequent sprints or the backlog:

- **Adaptive Element Locators:** Enhance the AI to generate more robust locators that are less prone
  to breaking from minor UI changes.
- **Smart Assertion Generation:** Allow the AI to suggest or automatically create assertions based
  on expected outcomes or analysis of the application state.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Expand the results display (`server/models/TestReport.js`) to include
  detailed step-by-step logs, screenshots at key moments or on failure, and potentially performance
  metrics.
- **User & Admin Enhancements:** Implement multi-factor authentication, detailed user activity logs,
  and system health monitoring dashboards in the Admin panel.
- **Test Scheduling and History:** Allow users to schedule tests to run at specific times and view a
  history of past test runs and their reports.
- **Integration with ALM Tools:** Deepen integration with JIRA, Confluence, Azure DevOps, etc.,
  beyond just parsing links, potentially allowing test results to be linked back to tickets.
- **Automated Test Healing:** Develop AI capabilities to analyze test failures and suggest or
  automatically apply fixes to test steps or locators.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Add the ability to capture screenshots and compare them against
  baselines to detect visual changes.

### 4. Risks or Concerns Identified

- **AI Generation Quality:** The primary risk is that the AI (Gemini) may not always generate
  relevant, accurate, or executable test cases from the provided documentation or web app structure.
  This is an evolving area.
- **Element Locator Reliability:** Identifying elements reliably on dynamic or complex web pages is
  challenging, even with AI assistance. Locators breaking is a common issue in web testing.
- **Test Execution Flakiness:** Headless browser execution can be prone to flakiness due to timing
  issues, network latency, or unexpected popups/modals on the target application.
- **Parsing Complexity:** Effectively parsing varied formats of documentation (JIRA descriptions,
  Confluence pages, simple text) and complex web application DOM structures is difficult.
- **Performance & Scalability:** Running multiple headless browser instances concurrently for test
  execution can be resource-intensive and will require careful management for scalability.
- **Security:** Testing external URLs requires careful security considerations to prevent abuse or
  unintended interactions.
- **Scope Creep:** The potential features are vast. It's crucial to stay focused on delivering the
  core value before adding many advanced features.

### 5. Recommendations for the Development Team

- **Focus on the Core Loop:** Prioritize completing the Input -> Generate -> Execute -> Basic Result
  flow end-to-end in this sprint. This validates the core concept.
- **Iterate on AI Prompts:** Spend time experimenting with different prompts for the Gemini model in
  `server/gemini.js` to optimize the relevance and structure of generated test cases. Start simple
  and iterate.
- **Select and Integrate Execution Library:** Choose a headless browser library (Puppeteer or
  Playwright are good candidates) early in the sprint and focus on getting a single, simple test
  step (like navigating to the URL) to execute successfully.
- **Define Test Case Structure:** Agree on a clear, executable data structure for the `TestCase`
  model (`server/models/TestCase.js`) that the execution engine can easily interpret.
- **Implement Basic Logging:** Add robust logging, especially in the server-side components
  (`server/index.js`, `server/gemini.js`, execution module), to help diagnose issues during
  generation and execution, as these are the most complex parts.
- **Frequent Communication:** Given the interdependencies between the UI, server endpoint, AI logic,
  and execution engine, maintain close communication within the team.

Let's get this core functionality built and validated! Good luck with the sprint!
