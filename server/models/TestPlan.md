# Documentation for `server\models\TestPlan.js`

## File Path

`server/models/TestPlan.js`

## Overview

This file defines the Mongoose schema and model for storing test plans generated by an AI. It
structures the data associated with a specific test plan, including details about the user who
initiated it, the application URL and documentation link it's based on, the AI model used, and the
actual content of the test plan (which consists of multiple test cases, each with multiple steps).

Located within the `server/models` directory, this file is part of the backend's data access layer,
defining how test plan data is represented and interacted with in the MongoDB database. It works in
conjunction with other models like `User` and potentially `TestReport` or `TestCase` (depending on
how those models are used).

## Dependencies

- `mongoose`: Used for defining schemas, models, and interacting with MongoDB.

## Schemas

This file defines three Mongoose schemas: `TestStepSchema`, `AiTestCaseContentSchema`, and
`TestPlanSchema`.

### `TestStepSchema`

Defines the structure for a single step within a test case. These steps are typically embedded
within a `AiTestCaseContentSchema`.
